            I suppose the answer is very obvious. You might be very good at developing or competitive coding but, you are not good enough if you don’t know how to sell it. To sell is one of the most important skills one should have.

              I feel comfortable working with many Adobe products. Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign,
              Lightroom or Xd are some kind of industry standards and I love working with them. I'm
              not limited to them, though: Gimp, Inkscape or Figma are also very valid applications
              that I've been working with.
            </p>

              User interfaces, brochures, books, branding... You name it! As I mentioned, creating
              pretty things is particularly important for me.
